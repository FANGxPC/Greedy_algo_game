# 🎮 Greedy Bag Race

Greedy Bag Race is a **turn-based strategy game** based on **Greedy Algorithms**, where players race to pick items into a limited-capacity bag.  
The goal is simple: **collect more items than your opponent before the bag is full or items run out**.

The game supports **Single Player (vs Computer)** and **Local Multiplayer**, with multiple AI difficulty levels demonstrating different greedy strategies.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Greedy Algorithm**
  - Easy: Random item selection
  - Medium: Maximum value selection
  - Hard: Maximum value-to-weight ratio
- 👥 **Game Modes**
  - Single Player vs Computer
  - Local Multiplayer (2 Players)
- 🔄 **Turn-Based Gameplay**
- 🎨 **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
- 🔊 **Sound Effects & Background Music**
- 📊 **Live Bag Weight Tracking**
- 🏆 **Automatic Winner Declaration**

---

## 🕹️ Game Rules

- Each player has a bag with a **fixed weight capacity**
- Players take turns picking **one item at a time**
- An item can be picked by **only one player**
- A player **cannot pick an item** if it exceeds remaining bag capacity
- The game ends when:
  - All items are picked, OR
  - Both players can no longer pick any item
- The player with **more items** wins

## 🧠 AI Strategy Logic

| Difficulty | Strategy Used |
|----------|---------------|
| Easy | Random valid item |
| Medium | Item with maximum value |
| Hard | Item with maximum value/weight ratio |

This makes the game a practical demonstration of **greedy decision-making**.
